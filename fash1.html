<p>Many people nowadays are only interested in wearing what they see others wear even though it might not suit them or be comfortable for them. It's all about following the trends at the detriment of their own comfort and sanity but that's not what fashion is about!!</p>
<p>Let's understand what fashion is. Fashion is all about expressing yourself in the way you look. There's a saying:<q><em>Dress how you want to be addressed</em></q>. If you saw someone walking down the street in a white lab coat with a stethoscope,your first thought would be 'Oh, that's a doctor', that's because that is the fashion statement of a doctor!That is what they can be identified with.</p>
<p>Which leads me to these questions:<br></p>
<p><pre><i>'What can you be identified with?
What is your signature?
How can we describe you on first sighting?
What do your clothes depict about your personality?
Who Are You?'</i></pre></p>
<br> Join me on this journey as we discover <b><mark>THE REAL YOU!</b></mark></style></p>
